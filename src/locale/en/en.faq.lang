What are \"Ranks\" and how can I use them?

[CMD_FAQ_RANKS_A]
Ranks are used to assign roles to people when they reach a certain amount of invites.
For example. if you have a role called `@Beginner` and you want people who have 5 or more invites to be added to that role, you would have to create a rank for that like so:
`{{ prefix }}add-rank @Beginner 5 (and if you want a description here)`.
